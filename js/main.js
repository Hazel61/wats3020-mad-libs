    O ${honorific}! my ${honorific}! our ${adjective1} trip is done;
    The ${vehicle} has weather'd every rack, the ${precious} we sought is won;
    The ${parking} is near, the ${noiseMaker} I hear, the people all ${crowdBehavior},
    While follow ${bodyPart1} the steady keel, the vessel ${adjective4} and ${adjective5}:
    But O ${organ}! ${organ}! ${organ}!
    O the bleeding drops of ${color},
    Where on the ${vehiclePart} my ${honorific} lies,
    Fallen ${adjective2} and ${adjective3}.

    ${number2}
    O ${honorific}! my ${honorific}! rise up and hear the ${noiseMaker};
    Rise up-for you the ${thing} is flung-for you the bugle trills;
    For you ${thing2} and ribbon'd ${thing3}-for you the shores a-crowding;
    For you they ${crowdBehavior}, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
    Here ${honorific}! dear ${familyMember}!
    This ${bodyPart2} beneath your ${bodyPart3};
    It is some dream that on the ${vehiclePart},
    You've fallen ${adjective2} and ${adjective3}.

    ${number3}
    My ${honorific} does not answer, his lips are pale and still;
    My ${familyMember} does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;
    The ${vehicle} is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;
    From fearful trip, the victor ${vehicle}, comes in with ${precious} won;
    Exult, O shores, and ring, O ${noiseMaker}!
    But I, with mournful tread,
    Walk the ${vehiclePart} my ${honorific} lies,
    Fallen ${adjective2} and ${adjective3}.
